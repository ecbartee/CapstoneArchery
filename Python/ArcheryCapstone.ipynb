    "        1.  A lookup table was created containing the various 3D target animals along with information on the color, size, name, and target pattern. \n",
    "        2.  A Survey123 was created to collect shoot conditions for each tournament.  Data was collected to capture the shoot name, shoot location (indoor or outdoor), shoes (minimal, hiking boots, sandals, gym shoes), temperature, weather conditions present (sunny, cloudy, humid, windy, foggy, light rain, heavy rain, stormy), and personal conditions (well rested, tired, sick, sore, hungry, full).\n",
    "        3.  A Survey123 was created to collect several details for each shot on the individual target and appearance (animal, range, position, elevation, lighting), shot execution (confidence, release details, execution details), and placement (score, aim placement, actual arrow impact). "
